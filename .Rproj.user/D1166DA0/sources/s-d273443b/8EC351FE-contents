get_crime_data()
# The function get_crime_data() 
# returns a tidy data tibble or
# simple features (SF) object of
# crime data with each row
# representing a single crime.
# The data provided for each
# offense includes the offense
# type, approximate offense
# location and date/time.
# More fields are available for
# some records, depending on what
# data have been released by each
# city. For most cities, data are
# available from 2010 onward, with
# some available back to 2007. Use
# list_crime_data() to see which
# years are available for which
# cities. More detail about what
# data are available, how they were
# constructed and the meanings of
# the different categories can be
# found on the CODE project website.
